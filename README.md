# Value Per Acre Analysis Resources

Fans and followers of the Strong Towns movement like to see their municipal data visualized. Organizations like Urban 3 have pioneered compelling ways to do this in places across North America. This repository is meant to help people take the "bottom up approach" to unlocking their own munipal data.

### Contents of this Repository

- `python_scripts`: contains various Python scripts for QGIS usage to assist with labeling, coloring, organizing data in your GIS project.
- `symbology_presets`: value/acre maps really pop when the color (and the value) ranges are aligned to fit your local municipality. A few examples are in here that can be loaded for a layer's symbology settings.

### Tools & Resources

- [QGIS](https://qgis.org/) - a free and open-source GIS mapping tool. Most of the resources in this repository will be aligned around this tool due to its availablity and (no) cost.
- [ArcGIS Search](https://www.arcgis.com/home/search.html) - most municipalities are using the commercial **ArcGIS** product to manage their maps, however the data is compatible with **QGIS**. You can search for parcel data here, many municipalities make it easy to find, others not so much - if at all. Search `"<Municpality Name> Parcel"` to get started exploring.
